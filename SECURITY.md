## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by creating a ticket directly on this repository.

We ask that you clearly describe the vulnerability and provide steps to reproduce it. Your contributions will help us quickly resolve potential issues.

You can send us video evidence of how you exploited the vulnerability by email.
